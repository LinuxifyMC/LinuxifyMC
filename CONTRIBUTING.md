# Contribution
Thanks for being interested in contributing to LinuxifyMC. Here are some guidelines and some other info on how to contribute correctly.
## Guidelines
- Send pull requests ALWAYS to the testing branch. Pull requests sent to the main branch will be closed, but before that I will test the code on my latest testing branch build.
- Avoid lots of code duplication, including lots of comments.
- Don't contribute with lots of AI code (code with less than ~70% AI code is fine, though, as long as it isn't too messy), try to make some parts of the code by yourself instead. AI autocomplete is fine.
- Before submitting a PR, make sure that you fully tested your code changes (I test all the code anyway).
- Keep your PRs fairly small for a faster and easier review by the maintainers.
## Development Environment Setup
- JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA (optional but recommended unless you have a bad PC)
- JDK Version 21 or Later
- A minecraft testing server you can test the plugin on (Java 21 or Later)
