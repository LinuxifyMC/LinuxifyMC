# TODO
- Remade filesystem (machine.fs.FakeFS) [Somewhat Done]
- A custom logger (will store logs in files)
- An API for the Filesystem
- Machine on-and-off states
- Login Manager + Su/Sudo Commands
- Possibly a custom package manager (will be a part of non-linux-commands)
- Some possible internet simulation (will also include IPv4 addresses and maybe possibly IPv6 addresses, including Local IPv4/Local IPv6)
- /vm or /vmachine or /virtualmachine command for managing your LinuxifyMC "virtual machine" (not an actual virtual machine, just simulation)
- Eventually make there be REAL binaries in /usr/bin containing REAL java code and possible creation of your own binaries
